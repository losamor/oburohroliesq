excerpt: Reading in Nigeria has always carried a strange mix of pride and
  neglect. It is praised loudly in speeches, classrooms, and policy documents,
  yet practiced quietly by a shrinking number of people. The country has
  produced world-class writers and scholars, but everyday reading—outside exams
  and professional requirements—often feels like an afterthought.

For many Nigerians, reading is tied almost entirely to school. From primary school to university, books are tools for passing tests, not companions for curiosity or pleasure. Once exams are over, the habit fades. This isn’t because Nigerians dislike stories or ideas. Oral culture is strong, and conversations, debates, music, and storytelling thrive. The issue is that reading has been framed as work, not leisure. When a habit is built around pressure, it rarely survives freedom.

Access is another major factor. In many towns, bookshops are rare or stocked mainly with textbooks. Public libraries exist in name but are underfunded, outdated, or simply locked. New books are expensive relative to average income, making reading a luxury rather than a routine choice. When someone has to choose between a novel and data for their phone, the decision is often already made.

Digital media has further reshaped attention. Social media, short videos, and instant messaging dominate how people consume information. This isn’t unique to Nigeria, but the effect is sharper where reading habits were already fragile. Many people now read constantly—tweets, captions, chats, headlines—but rarely sit with long-form text. Skimming has replaced immersion. Information moves fast, but depth is lost along the way.

Still, it would be wrong to say reading culture is dead. It has simply shifted. Online communities, book clubs on WhatsApp and X, and Nigerian-focused reading challenges show that interest is alive. Young Nigerians are discovering local authors, sharing quotes, and reviewing books in ways that were impossible a decade ago. Audio books and e-books are also lowering barriers, especially for people who cannot easily access physical books.

Schools and parents remain central to any revival. When children see adults read for enjoyment, not just obligation, the message sticks. A home with even a small shelf of books can shape a child’s relationship with reading for life. The same applies in classrooms: encouraging discussion, curiosity, and independent reading matters more than forcing memorization.

Reading culture in Nigeria is not beyond saving. It needs reframing. Reading should not be sold only as a path to success or intelligence, but as a source of pleasure, escape, and understanding. When books are treated less like school equipment and more like everyday companions, the habit has room to grow again.
