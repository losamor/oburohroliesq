excerpt: Ifunanya Nwangene’s death is not evidence that Nigeria has failed — it is evidence that Nigerians as individuals have failed to take responsibility for societal advancement. This commentary explores how private sector apathy, cultural attitudes toward work, and individual complacency undermine progress more than government alone.

Every time a tragedy strikes in this country, the chorus is almost automatic: “The government has failed us.” “Nigeria is broken.” “Nothing works here.” Yet, if we pause for a moment and think carefully, is that truly the case? Or are we, as citizens, failing Nigeria ourselves?
Consider the case of Ifunanya Nwangene. A young life, full of promise, cut short under circumstances that could have been mitigated. Many have blamed the state, the system, or the government. But pause and ask: who truly holds responsibility? Was it the presidency that should have stocked the hospital with lifesaving anti-venoms? Was it the government that directly controls every hospital’s internal budget and decision-making? Or was it the private individuals who manage these institutions, make procurement decisions, and allocate resources?
The answer, painfully clear, is that responsibility often lies with those closest to the point of failure. The government is not omnipresent. Public institutions are operated by human beings. And when these individuals fail, we are quick to displace the blame onto some abstract “system,” as if responsibility dissolves because it is inconvenient to confront.

## Responsibility Beyond Government
Let us step back and consider how the world actually works. In Western countries, children are groomed from a young age to understand responsibility in its truest sense: taking charge of one’s life. Responsibility is not simply going to school, holding a job, or paying bills. It is the active contribution to society, creating opportunities, and using one’s skills to improve not only oneself but the community around them.
Ask yourself: how many Nigerian children are prepared to leave the home at eighteen with the expectation that they will navigate life’s challenges independently? How many are taught to create their own opportunities, rather than wait for a government handout? In the United States, for example, children may start working small jobs at 13, learning the principles of earning, innovation, and problem-solving long before they graduate. They understand that survival and success are not privileges granted by the state—they are earned through creativity, adaptability, and initiative.
From restaurants to corporate offices, every avenue is an opportunity to contribute. Even seemingly modest jobs—driving, cooking, repairing, or testing systems—are valuable because they build human capital, teach discipline, and generate income. There is no stigma attached to labor; there is pride in being productive.

The Digital Frontier and the Nigerian Disadvantage
Today, the world’s economy is evolving faster than ever. AI, social media, gaming platforms, and digital entrepreneurship have created avenues to generate wealth that simply did not exist twenty years ago. Yet, Nigeria remains largely unprepared to capitalize on these opportunities.
Take online platforms, for instance. In the United States, someone can earn hundreds of dollars playing games, testing apps, or creating content online. AI tools can amplify productivity, streamline processes, and unlock new income streams. In Nigeria, these same opportunities exist but are largely inaccessible due to structural barriers: expensive data, limited platform reach, slow internet, and restricted access to digital ecosystems. Even when opportunities appear, Nigerians often encounter systemic hurdles that the Western private sector has long eliminated for its citizens.
So when people complain that “there are no opportunities,” we must ask: which opportunities exist, and who is responsible for making them accessible? Is it the government alone, or the private individuals and companies that control the platforms, resources, and infrastructure?

## Private Sector Accountability
Let us turn our attention to Nigeria’s wealthy individuals and corporations. Companies and business magnates—such as Dangote—amass enormous wealth, yet their contributions to systemic societal improvement are often minimal. Charitable donations exist, but where are the foundations that actively empower citizens to innovate, build apps, create platforms, and generate their own income?
Imagine if private sector wealth were systematically invested in creating digital ecosystems for Nigerians: training in AI, game development, software creation, and online entrepreneurship. Opportunities to earn money online, to participate in the global digital economy, to innovate and scale businesses—these could exist here, but they do not. Why? Because in many cases, profit and status outweigh responsibility and accountability. The private sector thrives on the backs of Nigerians, yet rarely invests in enabling Nigerians to thrive independently.
When tragedies like Ifunanya’s death occur, people blame the government, but what about the private sector that controls resources, infrastructure, and potential solutions? Why is there no systemic provision of medical essentials, training, or platforms that could prevent these incidents or empower citizens to prevent such tragedies in the first place?

## Work, Pride, and the Culture of Contribution
A deeper issue is the perception of work itself. In Nigeria, prestige is often attached to a title or position rather than contribution. Lawyers, doctors, and corporate employees are praised primarily for their status, not their societal impact. Meanwhile, drivers, electricians, mechanics, or small-scale entrepreneurs contribute daily to the functioning of society, yet are undervalued.
True responsibility is not showing up to a “prestigious” job. It is contributing in meaningful ways, no matter the scale, with consistency and accountability. If citizens embraced this principle, much of the systemic decay we observe would begin to reverse itself.
Consider Ifunanya’s case again. The hospitals are likely run by private entities, funded in part by citizens, managed by individuals with budgets and responsibilities. If the staff and management were acting with full accountability, would the tragedy have occurred? Possibly not. And yet, the outrage focuses almost exclusively on government figures, while the individuals directly responsible remain largely invisible.

## Health, Environment, and Long-Term Consequences
Beyond immediate tragedies, Nigeria faces a slow accumulation of societal and environmental hazards: poor healthcare access, inadequate medical supplies, environmental degradation, chemical exposure, and increasing disease rates—including cancers among young adults.
Ask yourself: who is accountable for these systemic risks? The government certainly plays a role, but so do private corporations that produce harmful products, release pollutants, and exploit resources without regard for long-term consequences. Who ensures that hospitals have essential medications or antidotes? Who monitors environmental compliance or enforces accountability? Much of this falls to individuals and organizations that choose profit over public good.

## Why the Government Cannot Carry Us Alone
Nigeria is neither a socialist nor a fully capitalist society. The government cannot be omnipotent. Its role is to create structures, enforce regulations, and provide frameworks for societal development. It is not meant to spoon-feed citizens or compensate for every private or individual failure.
Yet, our collective mentality often treats the government as omnipotent and absolves ourselves from responsibility. We expect leaders to solve our problems while ignoring the power and obligation of private individuals, communities, and citizens to contribute meaningfully.

## The Core Lesson
Ifunanya’s death is not a signal that Nigeria, as a country, has failed. It is a mirror reflecting a more uncomfortable truth: citizens and private actors are failing the country.
1. We are failing by undervaluing contribution over status.
2. We are failing by waiting for handouts instead of creating opportunities.
3. We are failing by ignoring our power to innovate, build, and enforce accountability.
4. We are failing by praising wealth while excusing inaction.
Tragedies like Ifunanya’s are not inevitable. They are preventable—but only if Nigerians collectively adopt a culture of responsibility, contribution, and accountability that goes beyond complaining or blaming the government.
So the real question is not: “Why has Nigeria failed?”
It is: “What are we doing, right now, to stop ourselves from failing?”
And if we truly embrace that responsibility, we may discover that the solutions have been in our hands all along.
